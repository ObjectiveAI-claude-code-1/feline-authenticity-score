Evaluate whether the cat in this image is engaged in genuine, unperformed behavior. Examine the cat's body language, posture, and physical state for signs of authentic feline behavior — the boneless limpness of true sleep, the committed wildness of a mid-leap body, the half-closed eyes of contented kneading, the alert crouch before a pounce. Assess whether the moment feels like something the cat arrived at naturally on its own, or whether it appears to have been arranged or staged by human hands. Check for signs of contrivance: costumes, constructed sets, treats visibly luring the cat's gaze toward the camera, or poses that feel physically unnatural for a cat to adopt voluntarily. Human presence does not automatically reduce authenticity — a cat pressing into a person's hand or curled in someone's lap can be deeply authentic — but the interaction must feel mutual and genuine rather than forced or manufactured. Score higher when the cat's behavior is unmistakably real and the moment feels honest, and score lower when the moment feels manufactured, performed, or staged.
