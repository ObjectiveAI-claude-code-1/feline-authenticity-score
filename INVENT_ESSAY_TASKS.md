Task 1 — Assess Bodily Naturalism: Examine the cat's physical state within the image to determine whether its posture, musculature, and overall bodily configuration reflect voluntary, natural feline behavior. A cat's body is biomechanically honest — genuine sleep produces a boneless surrender of limbs at improbable angles with visibly released musculature, a real pounce commits the whole skeleton with coiled haunches and focused eyes, and true contentment reveals itself through half-closed eyes and relaxed weight. This task must read the cat's body as a first witness: does this physical state look like something the cat's body would actually do, on its own, in this context? A cat sprawled belly-up in a sunbeam signals authentic comfort; a cat balanced on hind legs in sunglasses signals external arrangement. The task evaluates whether the cat's posture speaks of internal impulse or external manipulation, recognizing that the total physical configuration — not any single detail — tells the story of whether the body arrived at this position voluntarily.

Task 2 — Evaluate Environmental Integrity: Look beyond the cat's body to the surrounding scene and determine whether the environment supports or undermines the story of a natural moment. Authentic feline life unfolds in plausible settings — windowsills, cardboard boxes, rumpled beds, garden walls, cluttered desks, laptop keyboards, shopping bags — the ordinary theaters where cats actually spend their time. This task must identify signs of staging: costumes or accessories placed on the cat, miniature furniture or props arranged for the photograph, studio backdrops, treats or toys visibly positioned to lure the cat's attention, or any object or setting that no cat would naturally discover and claim on its own. Crucially, human environments do not compromise integrity — cats live in human homes and are drawn to human objects constantly. The question is not whether the environment is wild or domestic, but whether it is a plausible setting for a cat doing cat things, or whether it has been deliberately constructed to produce an image.

Task 3 — Judge Relational Genuineness: Assess the nature and quality of any interaction occurring in the frame — between the cat and humans, objects, other animals, or the camera itself — to determine whether the cat appears to be a willing, active participant or a passive subject having a moment imposed upon it. The key distinction is agency: a cat leaning into a scratch behind the ears is participating, visibly directing the hand with the tilt of its head and the pressure it applies; a cat held aloft in an unnatural position while staring wide-eyed at the camera is being acted upon. This task must also read the cat's relationship with the camera — a cat unaware of or indifferent to the photographer reads as more authentic than one whose gaze has been deliberately directed toward the lens. The most genuine feline images carry the quality of stolen moments, where the cat was doing something real and the photographer happened to catch it. Human presence does not diminish authenticity, but the interaction must feel mutual and voluntary, with the cat appearing to have a choice and appearing to be choosing this.
